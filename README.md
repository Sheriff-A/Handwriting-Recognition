# MLP
Multi Layer Perceptron (using PyTorch)

This repository demonstrates an easily adaptable classification neural network. This simple neural network was design with multi-layer perceptron framework using PyTorch. It shows the ability to take a simple neural network and generate a trained model with high accuracy that can be exported for reusability and external application. The model was designed to be trained on the MNIST data set. This is a data set of handwritten digits which the network trains to recognize. However, the model is not limited to this data set. A number of classification data sets or problems can be applied to this model and retrained with little to no need for data preprocessing.
